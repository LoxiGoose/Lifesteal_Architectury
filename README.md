# Lifesteal
**....is a Minecraft mod inspired by the original Lifesteal SMP plugin where killing other players steals their hearts for your own gain**

***This mod may be used in any modpack.***

**This mod needs to be installed on _BOTH_ the _SERVER_ and the _CLIENT_ as it adds new custom content and textures into the game!**

## ü§î Why should you choose this over other Lifesteal mods?

**For one.. almost all of the features in the mod are customizable in the config and can be disabled to your liking**

#### ‚ûï Features

- Lose hearts when you die at all, and be able to kill players to gain those hearts back
- Upon losing all hearts, whatever is set in the config, you can be banned or set into spectator mode
- Revive players that have lost all their hearts automatically after some time
- An entire new ore added that can spawn underground in the overworld and in the nether, which is used to - craft multiple items in this mod.
  - A new crystal item that can be used to draw the path to immortality.
  - Cores of the crystal that can be used to patch and eat your wounds.
  - Revive players with a Revive Crystal once they lose all their hearts!
- New advancements and challenges to get
- New structures to explore
- Lore involved in the mod with these structures!
- Compatibility with multiple mods!
- Useful commands for console, operators and non-operators!
  - Prefix: /ls
  - Command: sethitpoints
    - Can be used to change someone's max hearts
  - Command: gethitpoints
    - Can be used to get someone's max hearts
  - Command: withdraw
    - Can be used to withdraw a certain amount of hearts
  - Command: reviveplayer
    - Can be used to revive someone that was banned from the mod directly. This works exactly how reviving a player with a revive crystal would work

**And most importantly.. this is the _only_ Lifesteal mod that is updated occasionally, made to be on all popular mod loaders, and ported to latest versions of Minecraft!**

## ‚õèÔ∏è Ores and Recipes
The mod introduces a new ore named the "Heart Ore", it has been stated that it has many different variants that can be found on different areas of the deep underground or the nether.
   - People say that Heart Ore/Deepslate Heart Ore can be spotted from -50 to 70 y.
   - Miners say that Nether Heart Ore can be spotted in the entire nether below roof level.

With these ores.. there comes geodes as well that can be found..
  - Lucky ones have stated that Deepslate Heart Geode can be spotted around -20 y..
  - Luckier have found that Nether Heart Geode is the richest found beneath lava.

Recipes can be found with JEI/REI or you can "learn" them from the MC Recipe Book by finding certain items

## üí∞ Config
Obviously with a mod like this, you must have many goodies on the configuration file of course!

The config is located in the "config" folders in your MC directory or server folder and is named "lifesteal-common.toml".

## ‚ùì FAQ
- Can I change recipes?
  - You need to use a [datapack](https://cloudmian.duckdns.org/s/Si2SCFLkqJ9c5cZ), KubeJS or CraftTweaker to change recipes.
- Does this work with other mods that add hearts?
  - Indeed so! The mod works as expected when other mods add hearts.
- My friend was banned and didn't spawn a revive head! What do I do?!
  - Use the /ls reviveplayer command to bring back your friend.

#### ‚ùó Incompatibilities
- Origins can be buggy at times, this is being looked into to be fixed for the near future
